SynchronizedNotifications
====================
This wearable sample demonstrates using listener services to create three kinds of notifications; a phone only notification, a wearable only notification, and a notification that appears on both the phone and wearable, with one automatically disappearing when the other is dismissed.

Build and Deploy
=============
This sample requires an Android handset or tablet running Android 4.3 or higher, and either the Android Wear emulator or an Android Wear device.

Build the solution and deploy the project SynchronizedNotifications to your Android device, and deploy the project Wearable to your Android Wear device or emulator.
