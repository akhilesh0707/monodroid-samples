Geofencing Wearable Sample
===========================
This sample demonstrates the use of geofencing with wearable devices, by notifying you when you are within a certain area.

Requirements
============
This sample requires a physical Android 4.3 or higher device, that is connected to an Android Wear device or the Android Wear emulator.

Building & Testing
==================
In order to build this solution, you will need Xamarin Studio 5.3 or later. Deploy the project called "Geofencing" to your phone or tablet, and the project called "Wearable" to your Android Wear device.

You may need to change the coordinates in the class Constants in the "Geofencing" project to coordinates that are closer to your location. Changing the values YERBA_BUENA_LATITUDE and YERBA_BUENA_LONGITUDE should work.
