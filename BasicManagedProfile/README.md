Basic Managed Profile
===============
This sample demonstrates how to create a managed profile. Managed profiles create a way to keep personal and business information separate on the same device.
*Note* Only one managed profile is supported on the device. A reboot is required to create a managed profile. Because of this, a physical device is strongly recommended.
