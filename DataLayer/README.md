DataLayer Sample
================
This sample demonstrates using the wearable APIs to send messages and stream data (an image in this sample) from an Android device to an Android Wear device.

Build and Deploy
================
Download Xamarin Studio 5.3 or higher and open the project solution. Right click the project DataLayer and set it as the startup project, then click build in the application menu. Then right click the project Wearable, set it as the startup project, then click build in the application menu.

You will need to deploy DataLayer to a physical Android device running at least Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. Wearable can be deployed to either an Android Wear device or the Android Wear emulator.
