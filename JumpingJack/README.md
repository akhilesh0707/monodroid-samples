Jumping Jack
==================
This sample demonstrates the use of the gravity sensor in the Android Wear device through a counter for jumping jacks that the user makes while wearing the device. Note: the jumping jacks must be fairly quick (2 seconds or less) for the jumping jacks to count. The counter can be reset from the settings screen accessed by swiping left.
